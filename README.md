This library was written with the intension of simplifying the library provided
by Jeff Rowberg [here](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/MPU6050)
for my specific project as well as separate the i2c communication logic from the
code to interact with the module.

## TODO

1. copy over the code I used in my project to detect falls and orientation
2. explore reducing the memory used by the library
